I used to have four pet tortoises but they have since died gruesome deaths or been subjected to a far worse fate.

tortoise 1: dropped down 5 floor balcony by baby cousin :(
tortoise 2: dried up somehow???
tortoises 3 and 4: given to neighbor. probably turned into soup...

I'm making another edit here.
